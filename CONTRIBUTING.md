Contributing to the Thunderbird Conversations project
=====================================================

We love pull requests from everyone.

* Fork the repository.
* Follow the instructions in the [README](README.md) to clone, just use the newly clone repository URL for your clone.
* Build & install as per the instructions.

Make sure the tests pass:

```
npm test
```

Make your changes and make sure the tests still pass, and that the changes work in Thunderbird. The general coding style we like is contained within the ESLint rules so follow the existing style and rules and if the tests pass you should be fine.

Push to your fork, and submit a pull request. The tests will also run automatically for the pull request, please make sure that they pass.

At this point you're waiting on us. We may take a few days to comment on your pull request. We may suggest some changes or improvements and alternatives.
